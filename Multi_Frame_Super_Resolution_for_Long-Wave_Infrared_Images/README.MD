# Multi-Frame Super-Resolution for Long-Wave Infrared Images

This project is record for my experiment for Multi-Frame Super-Resolution for Long-Wave Infrared Images

* Registration of 36 Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) 
* 4× Super-Resolution Implementation After Registration
* The computational speed is within 30 milliseconds, and the distance exceeds 3 kilometers.

Detail
---
Any subset of images can be selected from the 36 images for super-resolution, provided that the subset follows the original sequence and contains more than two images.

Tests conducted on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti graphics card show that the processing speed stably remains within 30 ms. Additionally, the code has been implemented in an interface mode, which can be easily packaged into a lib library for integration with Qt, and has been verified to run stably in practical tests.

The registration matrix and affine transformation matrix are exported as JSON files respectively. When used in Qt or on the camera, the locally precomputed JSON files (generated by the program) can be directly imported, after which super-resolution can be executed immediately. (Corresponding interfaces have been reserved for this purpose.)

This code incorporates CUDA-based implementations; please configure the environment for NVIDIA graphics cards properly before running it.
